# Pre-trained networks
We provide pre-trained networks trained on the VITON dataset. Please download *.pth from the [CHECKPOINTS Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CWgyodbc_kB0YCPIw89BSS6Oap6UtLc?usp=sharing) and put the downloaded files in ./checkpoints/ directory.
 
# Testing
We provide processed testing set. Please down the datasets.zip files from the [DATASET Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-HJNnFkLEjpXQs4s2BuxNPVPT-X6nwHr/view?usp=sharing) and unzip this files. test.py assumes that the downloaded files are placed in ./datasets/ directory.  
If you want to evaluate the quantitative metrics, run:  
> python test.py --list paired_list.txt  

If you want to obtain the qualitative results, run:  
> python test.py --list unpaired_list.txt  

The test results will be updata in the test_results files.
